4/12/18,,,n/a,n/a,silt,,3.9,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,centered; vertically oriented in bucket,no vectrino,n/a,,,Added ~ 3.9 grams to ~3 gal of water.  Circulated with a propellor pump (the ones used in the biofilm growth experiments)

Peristaltic pump tubes all have flow rate of 50 ml/min (except maybe for 27U)

Noted that pump 27U has slower flow rate.  All others have flow rate of 50 ml/min

Mass based on bucket test conducted earlier in the morning; where 0.37g walnut shell added to ~3 gallons of water yielded a transmission value of ~0.6
27U tubing replaced and all tubes checked for proper flow rate of 50mL/min"

Flume not cleaned between 5/11 and 5/24 experiments.  
Vectrino stopped collecting data after ~2.5 hrs due to computer sleep; changed Toughbook settings so that system now only sleeps after 4 hours.  
All pump tubes checked for flow rate of 50ml/min"
6/4/18,13:53,5:53 PM,1:48 PM,30,walnut shell flour (100 grade; labeled with DTAF),3 gallons added via 5-gallon container with nozzle over the course of 3 minutes,100g,0,215,40,0,downstream of test,,1 m upstream of test section; centered; positive x pointing downstream; 20 cm from bed,,,27u has flow closer to 40mL/min; 4 hrs of data collection.  Added sediment via 5-gallon container with nozzle; discharge of ~1gal/min and filled to 3 gal.
6/11/18,13:48,17:48,2:15 PM,30,walnut shell flour (100 grade; labeled with DTAF),at 2:30pm; 3 gallons added via 5-gallon container with nozzle over the course of 3 minutes,100g,183,215,40,0,downstream of test,,1 m upstream of test section; centered; positive x pointing downstream; 20 cm from bed,,,Vectrino unable to connect and software crashed multiple times so no vectrino data was collected.  (Note: The following day 6/12; attempted to collect vectrino data as a diagnostic test and it worked just fine.)  Sediment added via same method as 6/4 (via nozzle) but it finished draining before the sediment had circulated through the flume and back to the point of sediment addition.  In time; there was a ~ 30 second gap until the sediment reached the point of addition.  Use ~4 gallons in the future.  27U pumping more slowly (roughly 40ml/min but steady).
6/27/18,13:30,17:30,1:37 PM,30,walnut shell flour (100 grade; labeled with DTAF),at 2:00-2:03pm; 3 gallons added via 5-gallon container with nozzle over the course of 3 minutes,100g,1830,215,40,0,downstream of test,,1 m upstream of test section; centered; positive x pointing downstream; 20 cm from bed,13.1,Water poured same day at 9:30am and LISST placed in bucket with water.  Background scattering value was collected at 11:50am.,Vectrino software connected and started collecting data initially but crashed within half an hour (twice).  Sediment trap C removed at end of data collection period; but the rest were stoppered in place and removed the following day.  All dowels within a ~2 inch radius of the sediment traps had to be removed to access the traps.
09/12/18,11:16:00 AM,01:16:00 PM,roughly 11:20,30,walnut shell flour (100 grade),"11:25-11:28, added gradually from downstream to upstream direction of flume in two passes, seeking to homogenize as quickly as possible",100g,0,214,40,0,downstream of test,vectrino in flume but not collecting data,1 m upstream of test section; centered; positive x pointing downstream; about 5 cm from bed,10,collected scatter in bucket (~11 ug/L) and flume (~10 ug/L),"vectrino said data speed was above max. so no data was collected, 1 sediment trap (I) came apart while being removed. All sediment traps were kind of difficult to remove."
