Particle size (Î¼m),approximate walnut shell grade,material,Source,Notes
1.25 - 250,60/200,road dust,Fauria et al. (2015); Table 3,corresponds to the range of detectable particles for the LISST used by the authors
177 - 210 (mean = 194),40/100,plastics resin (Pliolite),Palmer et al. (2004); p. 79,passed through sieves #70 and #80; 40/100 grade may be too widely distributed
212 - 250 (mean = 231),40/100,Pliolite particles,Purich (2006); p. 22,passed through standard British sieves; uniform distribution assumed through range
0.1; 1.05; 2.0; 10.5,#400 (flour grade),latex microspheres,Wu et al. (2011); p. 7778,paper examined colloids; the smallest available walnut flour grade is much larger
